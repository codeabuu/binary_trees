-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Trees are simply nodes connected together.
Binary tree is a kind of data structure used for storage purposes.
Each node of a binary tree can only have a maximum of two nodes called the children.
A simple binary tree consists of the ROOT, PATH AND CHILD nodes.
The root node is the node at the top of the tree. A tree can only have one root node and one path from the root node to any other node.
